# Garry Bilkhu - Developer (Temporary Page)

## About

I am driven by the curiousity and desire to study all things technical with a natural tendancy to figure out how things work. As I grow, my curious nature seems to pull me deeper into the application of sciences, pursuing subjects like Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science in my schooling. An aspect of technical work that I enjoy is that it nearly always involved data and analysis which has drawn me towards developing a passion for working with Computers, building them, programming them and learning more about them. 

Naturally I will use the things I have learned together in some areas like business intelligence, data visualization, and web development. I have ambitions to become a full-stack web developer, and believe that with my skills I can bring valueable contributions to a dev team as a junior developer.
