# Garry Bilkhu - Developer (Temporary Page)

## About

I am passionate about Computers, building them, programming them and learning more about them. Additionally, I enjoy working with and analyzing data, especially to tinker and figure out how things work. I also have some experience working with graphics design and making logos. Naturally I will use the things I have learned together in some areas like web development or data visualization. I have ambitions to become a full-stack developer, and I believe that with my skills I can bring valueable contributions to a dev team and continue expanding upon my knowledge and skills.
